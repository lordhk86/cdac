            <h3>Call of duty</h3>
            <p>here are few video games that have nestled their way into pop culture quite like Call Of Duty. Over the
                franchise’s 17 year history, Activision’s seminal shooter has taken players from the muddy trenches of
                1940s Germany to the drone-patrolled streets of Ethiopia in 2065.</p>
